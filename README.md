# LCARS LightShow

This is a demo project that indicates how a student can use Cordova to build an interface to their Spring-Boot Rest service that controls LED strips. This example uses the LCARS style library from [Jörn Weißenborn](https://github.com/joernweissenborn/lcars) to call a simple Spring-Boot web-service running on a network attached Raspberry-Pi.
